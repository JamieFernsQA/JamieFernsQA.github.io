My name is Jamie Ferns. My birth name is James John Ferns which I have never been called by as my fathers name is James Ferns also and that would lead to me being called "wee James" which my parents did not want.  I originally come from Scotland. I joined the royal highland fusiliers when I left school. Through this I done a tour of Afghanistan, got my truck license and picked up my PADI scuba diving qualification as well as numerous security qualifications. Once I left the army I studied computer animation at the university west of Scotland and did some freelance work involving this once I had my degree. I would like to progress within a career in the IT industry and to be able to develop my skills further.I do not have any formal training in programming languages but I have used javascript and java in previous employment where I used existing code as a template and modified it to suit whatever purpose it was needed for.
